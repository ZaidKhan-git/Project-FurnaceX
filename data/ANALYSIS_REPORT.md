- Early engagement = relationship building
- Better pricing negotiations
- Become preferred vendor before tendering
- Many projects source informally during planning

### Concern 2: "We're contacting before they need fuel"
**Mitigation:** Pre-approval contact is strategic
- Decision makers appreciate proactive vendors
- Builds awareness for procurement phase
- Opportunity to shape requirements
- Competition hasn't engaged yet

### Concern 3: "Data might become outdated"
**Mitigation:** Implement refresh cycle
- Re-scrape monthly
- Focus on freshest leads first
- Track status progressions
- Drop stale/withdrawn projects

## Technical Recommendations

### For Data Scientists:

1. **Build Lead Scoring Model**
   ```
   Score = (Recency * 0.3) + 
           (Category_Weight * 0.25) + 
           (Sector_Demand * 0.25) + 
           (Status_Active * 0.20)
   
   Where:
   - Recency: Days since submission (inverse)
   - Category_Weight: A=3, B1=2, B2=1
   - Sector_Demand: Mining=3, Infra=2.5, Industrial=2, Other=1
   - Status_Active: Under_Verification=3, Under_Exam=2.5, Referred=2, Other=1
   ```

2. **Implement Deduplication Logic**
   - Some files showed identical counts (forest_data = environmental_data)
   - May be duplicate entries
   - Verify with Proposal No. uniqueness check

3. **Enrich with External Data**
   - Company financials (payment capacity)
   - Historical procurement patterns
   - Ownership/group affiliations
   - Contact directories for decision makers

### For Engineers:

4. **Build Lead Management Dashboard**
   - Real-time lead queue for agents
   - Status tracking workflow
   - Geographic heat maps
   - Performance analytics

5. **API Integration**
   - CRM system (Salesforce, etc.)
   - Email automation platform
   - Data validation services
   - Contact enrichment APIs
